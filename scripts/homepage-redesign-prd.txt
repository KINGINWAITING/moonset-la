# MoonSet Homepage Redesign - Visual Consistency & Modern Design
## Product Requirements Document

### Project Overview
Transform the MoonSet homepage into a visually consistent, professional, and futuristic design with seamless dark/light mode transitions. Focus on modern glassmorphic cards, consistent theming, and beautiful animations while maintaining code simplicity (under 500 lines per file).

### Design Goals
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified design language across all components
- **Professional Appeal**: Clean, modern, futuristic aesthetic
- **Theme Integration**: Seamless dark/light mode transitions
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and responsive design

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Design System Foundation
Create a comprehensive design system with:
- Glassmorphic card variants (transparent, semi-transparent, gradient)
- Consistent color palette for both themes
- Typography scale and hierarchy
- Spacing system (8px base grid)
- Animation timing and easing functions
- Icon theming and consistency

#### 2. Homepage Section Redesign
Transform all major homepage sections:
- **Features Section**: Grid-based card layout with hover animations
- **Token Section**: Professional tokenomics presentation
- **Apollo Mission Section**: Immersive mission showcase
- **Framework Section**: Service cards with interactive elements
- **CTA Section**: Compelling call-to-action with visual appeal
- **Logo Carousel**: Elegant partner/technology showcase

#### 3. Theme System Enhancement
- Smooth color transitions between themes
- Theme-specific visual elements and animations
- Consistent component behavior across themes
- Performance-optimized theme switching

#### 4. Animation & Interaction Design
- Entrance animations for sections
- Hover states and micro-interactions
- Loading states and transitions
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Performance-optimized motion

#### 5. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Tablet and desktop optimizations
- Flexible grid systems
- Adaptive typography and spacing

### Technical Requirements

#### Code Structure
- Maximum 500 lines per file
- Reusable component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety

### Success Criteria
- Visually consistent design across all sections
- Smooth theme transitions under 300ms
- Professional, modern aesthetic appeal
- Mobile-responsive design
- Code maintainability with modular structure
- Performance metrics maintained or improved

### Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation**: Design system components and tokens
2. **Core Sections**: Features, Token, Apollo sections
3. **Interactive Elements**: Framework, CTA, Logo sections
4. **Polish**: Animations, transitions, and refinements
5. **Testing**: Cross-browser, responsive, and accessibility testing
