# MoonSet Truth Protocol Architecture Redesign - PRD

## Project Overview
Complete redesign of the FeaturesHighlight component to display the MoonSet Truth Protocol as a sophisticated computer architecture diagram, showing interconnected system components with animated data flows.

## Core Requirements

### 1. System Architecture Layout
- Replace current 3-column grid with layered architecture design
- 4 distinct layers: Community Interface (top), Processing Layer (middle), Data Layer (bottom), Analytics Overlay
- Components positioned to show logical data flow and system relationships
- Responsive design that adapts to mobile (vertical stack) and desktop (layered diagram)

### 2. Component Design
- Transform existing 6 components into hexagonal containers with technical styling
- Circuit board aesthetic with dark background and grid overlay
- Neon/glow effects for active states and connections
- Technical typography using monospace fonts for labels
- Status indicators showing component health/activity

### 3. Connection Network
- SVG-based connection lines between related components
- Animated connection paths with glowing effects
- Visual representation of data flow directions
- Color-coded connections for different data types (evidence, analysis, storage, monitoring)

### 4. Animation System
- Boot sequence animation showing system initialization
- Continuous particle flow animations along connection paths
- Interactive hover effects highlighting connected components
- System heartbeat animation every 10 seconds
- Performance optimized with hardware acceleration

### 5. Data Flow Visualization
- Blue particles: Evidence flow (Community → MARE → DEL)
- Purple particles: Analysis flow (MARE → Pattern Recognition)
- Green particles: Storage sync (DEL ↔ Data Archive)
- Orange particles: Monitoring data (All components → Analytics)

### 6. Technical Components Required
- ArchitectureDiagram (main container)
- SystemComponent (hexagonal component design)
- ConnectionNetwork (SVG connection system)
- ParticleSystem (animation engine)
- SystemMonitor (analytics overlay)

## Existing Components to Transform
1. MoonSet AI Research Engine (MARE) - Central processing hub
2. Decentralized Evidence Ledger (DEL) - Blockchain storage
3. Community-Driven & Rewarded - User interface layer
4. Advanced Pattern Recognition - Processing module
5. Immutable Data Archive - Persistent storage
6. Transparent Analytics - System monitoring overlay

## Performance Requirements
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Hardware acceleration using transform3d
- Particle pooling for memory efficiency
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion accessibility setting
- Mobile-optimized with reduced particle count on smaller screens

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion
- SVG for connection paths and geometric shapes
- CSS Grid for responsive positioning
- Canvas or SVG for particle systems
- Modular component architecture for maintainability

## Success Criteria
- Visual transformation complete with all 6 components in architecture layout
- Smooth animations running at 60fps on modern devices
- Responsive design working across all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance with reduced motion support
- Code maintainability with clean component separation
