# Sophisticated Wallet Connection System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Implement a sophisticated, production-ready wallet connection system for the portfolio page that supports the 5 most popular crypto wallets with seamless user experience, proper error handling, and modern best practices.

## Current State Analysis
The current wallet connection implementation has several issues:
- Only supports MetaMask through a basic Web3Context
- Limited error handling and user feedback
- No support for mobile wallets or WalletConnect protocol
- Basic UI without proper loading states
