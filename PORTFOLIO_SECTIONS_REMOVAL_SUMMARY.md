- **Imports cleaned**: 9 unused imports removed
- **Variables removed**: 2 mock data objects removed

## Technical Impact

### **Bundle Size Reduction**
- Removed dependencies on date-fns formatting
- Eliminated unused UI components
- Reduced import overhead
- Cleaner component tree

### **Performance Improvements**
- Fewer DOM elements to render
- Reduced component complexity
- Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- Simplified prop passing

### **Code Maintainability**
- Cleaner, more focused component
- Reduced cognitive load
- Easier to understand and modify
- Less mock data to maintain

## Current State

### **ActivitySidebar Component**
```tsx
export const ActivitySidebar = ({ totalValue, connected }: ActivitySidebarProps) => {
  // All sections removed as requested

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Sections removed as requested */}
      <div className="p-6 rounded-lg border border-border bg-card text-center">
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Activity sidebar content has been removed as requested.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Portfolio Layout Impact**
- **Right Panel**: Now contains only WalletActionsPanel and simplified ActivitySidebar
- **Main Content**: Unchanged - still shows holdings table and transactions list
- **Left Sidebar**: Unchanged - still shows wallet connection and portfolio summary

## User Experience Changes

### **Before Removal**
- Busy right sidebar with multiple data sections
- Portfolio stats, activity feed, and top performers
- Information-heavy interface with lots of visual elements

### **After Removal**
- Clean, minimal right sidebar
- Focus on core wallet functionality (send/receive)
- Reduced visual noise and cognitive load
- More space for main content consumption

## Future Considerations

### **Potential Re-additions**
If these sections need to be restored in the future:
1. **Portfolio Stats**: Could be integrated into main dashboard area
2. **Recent Activity**: Could be part of a dedicated activity page
3. **Top Performers**: Could be part of a market analysis section

### **Alternative Implementations**
- **Collapsible sections**: Add toggle functionality for optional viewing
- **Settings-based**: Allow users to choose which sections to display
- **Contextual display**: Show sections based on user actions or preferences

## Design Philosophy Maintained

### **Minimalistic Approach**
- Reduced visual clutter
- Focus on essential functionality
- Clean, professional appearance
- Consistent with forum page design philosophy

### **User-Centric Design**
- Prioritized core wallet operations
- Eliminated distracting elements
- Improved focus on main portfolio data
- Enhanced usability through simplification

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All components compile without errors
✅ **No Import Errors** - All unused dependencies properly removed
✅ **TypeScript Clean** - No type errors after cleanup
✅ **Component Integration** - ActivitySidebar still integrates properly with layout

## Conclusion

The Portfolio page now has a cleaner, more focused interface with the requested sections removed from the ActivitySidebar. The changes maintain the minimalistic design philosophy while reducing visual noise and improving the user experience by focusing on core wallet functionality.

The simplified ActivitySidebar now serves as a placeholder that can be easily extended in the future if additional functionality is needed, while the main portfolio features (wallet actions, holdings table, transactions list) remain fully functional and prominent.
